                <p> The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and our project team are beginning to research
                    information within the topics of ground support infrastructure, personnel, flight challenges, and
                    community infrastructure when dealing with airports and spaceports as commercial space travel
                    is beginning to become more common. In the commercial space industry, commercial space vehicles are
                    being launched at an increased rate, and they affect the safe operations of the aviation industry
                    and the other users of the NAS, as well as the uninvolved public community. Our research
                    identified five challenges that fall within the categories of flight challenges, personnel, ground
                    support infrastructure, and community infrastructure. These challenges we identified affect the
                    progress of integration of airport and spaceport activities.</p>
                <img src="/img/portfolio_faa/FAA_Presentation_IMG.JPG">
                <p>Specifically, the flight challenges include delays and reroutes of flights, mainly originating from
                    safety precautions. There is also a lack of real-time communication between air traffic controllers
                    and space operators. The lack of real-time communication affects how long a restricted airspace
                    is up, as well as contributing to the possibility of human error in communications. With that said,
                    air traffic controllers are also not trained to work with space operators and their operations. This
                    is because communication systems in place now do not allow for that collaboration, preventing
                    real-time information to flow between pilots, air traffic controllers, and space operators. Outside
                    of those, infrastructure is also a very important factor to support the frequency of launches. In-
                    land spaceports like Oklahoma Air & Spaceport, and others, do not have all the infrastructure
                    needed to support current launch operation trends, mainly with most having runways and not
                    vertical launch pads like Cape Canaveral or Vandenberg. Community infrastructure is also
                    another factor that could pose a challenge. The acceptable risk for launching space vehicles is not
                    as low as the acceptable risk for the operation of airplanes, and as such, it is best to have the
                    infrastructure and emergency plans ready to respond to possible catastrophic events.</p>
