                <b style="font-size: 30px"> Project Introduction </b>

                <p> This strategic consulting case serves as an instrument to faciliate comprehensive understanding of strategic concepts
                    and analytical tools, while also applying these knowledge and skills in real-life situations. In this strategic consulting case, 
                    my team members and I came together as a team of consultants to prepare a video case illustrating a Flink's strategic issue, provide 
                    comprehensive analysis, identify a single most strategic issue, and thoroughly make a strategic recommendation for the company. 
                </p>

                <b style="font-size: 30px"> Flink Introduction </b>

                <img src="/img/portfolio_flink/goflink_img1.jpg">
                <p> Flink is a German-based startup that sells food and grocery items at supermarket prices and delivers them
                    in under 10 minutes. Currently, Flink is operating in more than 60 cities across four countries: Germany, 
                    France, Netherlands, and Austria. Their competitors include other similar delivery services like Gorillaz, 
                    Deliveroo, Getir, and many more. Flink's estimated valuation is currently around $5 billion according to Dealroom.co, 
                    making it a unicorn in its industry.
                </p>

                <b style="font-size: 30px"> How Does Flink Operate? </b>
                <img src="/img/portfolio_flink/flink_rider.jpg">
                <p> The company operates dark warehouses and stores in the cities they are operating in. A dedicated staff of 
                    warerhouse pickers collects the items ordered from the app, and hands them over to delivery riders. The pickers and 
                    riders are actual employees of Flink on a full-time basis. Flink provides them e-bikes to make the deliveries, which 
                    is a big contrast to other services like Deliveroo or Instacart, which only hire drivers on a contractual basis.
                </p>

                <b style="font-size: 30px"> Strategic Issue </b>
                <p> The main threat to Flink and their industry is the market saturation of similar delivery service companies. The market
                    is quickly developing and many of the services are extremely similar, causing the customer base to be price sensitive.
                    The low cost of switching between these company allows the customers to switch between Deliveroo, Flink, Gorillaz and many
                    others depending on the price of the items. Due to this, each company must compete extremely competitively for their market
                    share.
                </p>

                <b style="font-size: 30px"> Strategic Recommendation </b>
                <p> The main threat to Flink is the worry that the market is thinning out, which means there are few active participants in the 
                    buy or sell side of the market. With the relative high barriers to entry within the market, some current active particpants will
                    either be bought out or consumed under another competitor, thus decreasing the number of providers of the service down to a few handful.
                    In order to avoid this, our strategic recommendation for Flink is to expand their operations overseas to the United States.
                </p>
                <p> The United States offers one of the highest market potential, cultural parallels, and infrastructure necessary to make the expansion 
                    successful. The majority of countries and continents in the southern hemisphere have large cultural discrepancies compared to Germany.
                    Countries in the Middle East, Nordic region, and Canada have non-ideal weather conditions, which will drastically reduce delivery services
                    year round. With these considerations, it would only leave a few countries suitable for expansion, of which the United States is the most ideal.
