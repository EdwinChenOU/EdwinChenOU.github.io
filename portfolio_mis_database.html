                <p> At the beginning of this project, we met with the client after having read up on the company to
                    ask questions and gather information that would assist us in creating this database. Once all of
                    our questions were answered, we began with the construction of the ERD, using both the revenue
                    and expenditure cycles. Once this step was completed, we began the process of Normalization.
                    During the Normalization process, we sought to convert the Entity Relationship Diagram to
                    Third Normal Form in order to ensure that all tables within the database were atomic and also to
                    eliminate data redundancies.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When building the database using the VMWare Enterprise Systems client as well as
                    Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio to build a database one table at a time that both
                    functions properly and generates the desired data, provided by generatedata.com, and does so
                    quickly and efficiently which can be further achieved through the process of denormalization.
                    Once we could ensure that the provided SQL Queries were both correctly answered and provided
                    the proper results, we did the same with the three additional queries that our group came up with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the conclusion of this project, the project management portion revealed a total of 189
                    hours and 20 minutes amounting to a total project cost of $4,733. Broken down further,
                    Milestone One had a combined work time of 51 hours and 30 minutes and a cost of $1,288,
                    Milestone Two had a combined work time of 17 and a cost of $425, Milestone Three had a
                    combined work time of 42 hours and 40 minutes and a cost of $1,067, and Final Submission had
                    a combined work time of 78 hours and 10 minutes with a cost of $1,954.
