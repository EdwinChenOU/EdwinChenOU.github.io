                <p> This machine learning project is the final project for my graduate level courses in Machine Learning.
                    The project is based off of a simple convolutional neural network classic, handwritten digit recognition, 
                    that many people create as one of their first digit recognition machine learning models. The concept is the 
                    same, except that instead of the normal numbers that one would write, I used used the model to recognize chinese 
                    characters instead. The reason being is that chinese character uses strokes to write, instead of the regular 
                    alphabet that most other languages use. The strokes in different writing styles can make it more difficult for 
                    the model to recognize, and it is an idea that I wanted to pursue and see what comes of it.
                </p>

                <p> The picture above shows some sample characters that are used to train the model. Most handwritten digit 
                    recognition models uses the handwritten digit dataset from MNIST, but I had curated my own small set of data 
                    to train with. I had used the numbers one through nine, each with around 15 images in different font styles 
                    to factor in variances in the same character. Each image is labeled with the correct classification of the image.

                <p> The code above is a simple convolutional neural network. The model takes in 
                    the input image at a size of 224 by 224 pixels into a convolutional 2D layer, followed by a pooling layer, which 
                    is then followed by another convolutional layer before one last pooling layer. The result of this last pooling 
                    layer is flattened, and then gets passed to a fully connected layer, before getting outputted by the last dense 
                    layer with 9 possible classifications.

                <p> Explanation of each layer for simple model:
                    <li>
                        Convlutional Layer: creates a convolution kernal that is wind with layers input which helps produce a tensor of
                        outputs. A kernel is a convolutional matris or filter which can be used for blurring, sharpening, embossing, edge
                        detection, and more by doing a convolution between a kernel and an image.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pooling layer: a MaxPool2D layer downsamples the input along its spatial dimensions by taking the maximum value
                        over an input window for each chanel of the input. the window is shifted by strides along each dimension. It progressively
                        reduce the spatial size of the input image, so that the number of computations in the network are reduced.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Dense layer: It is a regular densely-connected neural network layer, meaning each neuron in the dense layer receives input 
                        from all neurons of its previous layer. It takes the input from the previous layer and adds a bias before putting it through 
                        an activation function. The first dense layer connects to the second dense layer, which then outputs one of the nine classifications
                        as an output.
                    </li>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The code above shows a modified version of the VGG16 model architecture. The layers are the same as the VGG16 model for ImageNet,
                    however, it has been modified to fit the dimensions of the dataset I have created. The model itself is more complex than the previous
                    model, with bigger kernels, more nodes, and different orientation of convolution and pooling layers. The larger inputs and the additional
                    convolutional layers allow for the model to pick out more features to identify the images the model takes in. These additional convolutional
                    and pooling layers help greatly with more complex images like identifying scenery.

                    The dashboard itself needs lots of improvements, however I think it is a decent application of what I was taught in the class. There were lots of hours
                    spent on trying to figure out what went wrong in the back-end of the program, learning VBA was a little difficult, however it got easier with time. If you want to
