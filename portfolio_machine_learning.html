                <b style="font-size: 30px">Introduction</b>

                <p> This machine learning project is the final project for my graduate level courses in Machine Learning.
                    The project is based off of a simple convolutional neural network classic, handwritten digit recognition, 
                    that many people create as one of their first digit recognition machine learning models. The concept is the 
                    same, except that instead of the normal numbers that one would write, I used used the model to recognize chinese 
                    characters instead. The reason being is that chinese character uses strokes to write, instead of the regular 
                    alphabet that most other languages use. The strokes in different writing styles can make it more difficult for 
                    the model to recognize, and it is an idea that I wanted to pursue and see what comes of it.
                </p>

                <img src="/img/portfolio_machine_learning/sample_digits.png">
                <p> The picture above shows some sample characters that are used to train the model. Most handwritten digit 
                    recognition models uses the handwritten digit dataset from MNIST, but I had curated my own small set of data 
                    to train with. I had used the numbers one through nine, each with around 15 images in different font styles 
                    to factor in variances in the same character. Each image is labeled with the correct classification of the image.

                <p><b>Simple Convolution Neural Network Model</b></p>

                <img src="/img/portfolio_machine_learning/convolutional_model_architecture.png">
                <p> The chart above is a simple convolutional neural network. The model takes in 
                    the input image into a convolutional 2D layer, followed by a pooling layer, which 
                    is then followed by another convolutional layer before one last pooling layer. The result of this last pooling 
                    layer is flattened, and then gets passed to a fully connected layer, before getting outputted by the last dense 
                    layer with 9 possible classifications.

                <p><b>Complex and Conclusion of Convolutional Neural Network Model</b></p>
                <img src="/img/portfolio_machine_learning/vgg16_model_architecture.png">
                <p>
                    The code above shows a modified version of the VGG16 model architecture. The layers are the same as the VGG16 model for ImageNet,
                    however, it has been modified to fit the dimensions of the dataset I have created. The model itself is more complex than the previous
                    model, with bigger kernels, more nodes, and different orientation of convolution and pooling layers. The larger inputs and the additional
                    convolutional layers allow for the model to pick out more features to identify the images the model takes in. These additional convolutional
                    and pooling layers help greatly with more complex images like identifying scenery.
                </p>

                <p><b>Comparison of Models</b></p>

                <img src="/img/portfolio_machine_learning/model_results.png">
                <p>
                    The model results shows that the simple convolutional model is more accurate in validating the dataset comapred to the more advanced VGG16 
                    model. The precision and the recall scores for both models both support the fact that the more simple model is better at predicting the images
                    than the more advanced model. A probable reason for this is that the more advanced model picked out more features of the chinese characters than 
                    necessary and it caused the model to be wrong in its predictions. The "features" were likely to be minor differences in the font style of the 
                    written characters that the model deemed them to be classed differently.
