                <p> This machine learning project is the final project for my graduate level courses in Machine Learning.
                    The project is based off of a simple convolutional neural network classic, handwritten digit recognition, that many people
                    create as one of their first digit recognition machine learning models. The concept is the same, except that instead
                    of the normal numbers that one would write, I used used the model to recognize chinese characters instead. 
                    The reason being is that chinese character uses strokes to write, instead of the regular alphabet that most other languages
                    use. The strokes in different writing styles can make it more difficult for the model to recognize, and it is an idea that I wanted
                    to pursue and see what comes of it.
                </p>

                <p> The following picture shows some sample characters that are used to train the model. Most handwritten digit recognition models
                    uses the handwritten digit dataset from MNIST, but I had curated my own small set of data to train with. I had used the numbers
                    one through nine, each with around 15 images in different font styles to factor in variances in the same character. Each image 
                    is labeled with the correct classification of the image.
                </p>

                <p> The code below contains the model architecture of the simple convolutional neural network. The model takes in the input image at a size of 224
                    by 224 pixels into a convolutional 2D layer, followed by a pooling layer, which is then followed by another convolutional layer
                    before one last pooling layer. The result of this last pooling layer is flattened, and then gets passed to a fully connected layer, before getting
                    outputted by the last dense layer with 9 possible classifications.

                <p> Explanation of each layer:
                    <li>
                        Convlutional Layer: A Conv2D layer  acts like a "filter" of sorts. The layer is a kernel that has a size that is set by a parameter, in the model above,
                        the size of the layer is 3 by 3, three pixels wide by three pixels tall. This kernel filters through the image, 3x3 pixels at a time, with 32 nodes.
                    </li>

                    The dashboard shows Total Sales, Total Transactions, and Average Amount for the data in the Sales Data sheet. On the left hand side,
                    there are filters for Year and Gener, which will filter the data on the Sales Data sheet and the dashboard will reflect these changes.
                    You can filter by different years and different geners. Also on this left hand side is the tabs for Dashboard and State. Clicking on these
                    will take you to the Dashboard sheet or the State sheet, which will show you the total sales for each of the States given the filters you have applied.
                </p>

                    The state map shows a heatmap distribution based on the filters you applied on the Year you want to see and the Gender you have selected.

                    The dashboard itself needs lots of improvements, however I think it is a decent application of what I was taught in the class. There were lots of hours
                    spent on trying to figure out what went wrong in the back-end of the program, learning VBA was a little difficult, however it got easier with time. If you want to
